Structure of data produced by recursive BLAST:

(Overall hash of all results)
  (Each GI entered by user has its own hash, referring to results of its respective iteration of recursive BLAST)
    (within each of THESE hashes, 3 more hashes: GIs in both sets, GIs in only recursive BLAST, GIs in only PSI-BLAST)

Sample:
blast_results = {
  gi1 = {
    both = {
      ...
    }
    recursiveBlastOnly = {
      ...
    }
    psiblastOnly = {
      ...
    }
  }

  gi2 = {
    both = {
      ...
    }
    recursiveBlastOnly = {
      ...
    }
    psiblastOnly = {
      ...
    }
  }

  gi3 = {
    both = {
      ...
    }
    recursiveBlastOnly = {
      ...
    }
    psiblastOnly = {
      ...
    }
  }
